UC Berkeley PhD Thesis written in LaTex
=====

The master file is 'thesis.tex', which is the main file compiled by latex and where I have included different chapters, methods, etc.

The UC Berkeley thesis 'class' can be found as 'ucbthesis.cls'.

To compile: ./doit.sh

And the finished product can be found here:
