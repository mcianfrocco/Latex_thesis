Eva Nogales - great mentor; supportive, with me throughout this project even as it wasn't working
Thesis committee - providing great feedback and support; i felt like they were going to help me no matter what result that i got
Patricia Grob - teaching me everything I know
James Kadonaga \& George Kassavetis - amazing collaborators who contributed key experiments to understanding the role of the rearranged state in promoter binding 
Jie Fang - amazing biochemist
Tom Houweling - great computer support; was instrumental in all the owrk presented here.
Gabriel Lander - teaching me how to use leginon \& appion
