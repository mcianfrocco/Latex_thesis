   abstract = {We present a new reconstruction method that takes advantage of the fact that many biological macromolecular assemblies show a preferred orientation with respect to the plane of the specimen grid in the electron microscopic preparation. From one micrograph taken of such a specimen tilted by a large angle, a conical tilt series with random azimuthal angles can be extracted and used for a three-dimensional reconstruction. Our technique allows the determination of the molecular structure under low-dose conditions, which are not achievable with reconstruction methods that use conventional tilt series. The reconstruction method combines a number of existing image processing techniques with a newly developed weighted back-projection algorithm designed for three-dimensional reconstruction from projections taken with arbitrary projecting directions. The method is described as it was applied to the three-dimensional reconstruction of the structure of the 50S ribosomal subunit of Escherichia coli (E. coli).},

   abstract = {In computerized tomography as well as in most problems of three-dimensional reconstruction from projections, one knows from the experimental set-up the angular relationships between the projections from which the reconstruction is to be calculated. A serious difficulty is encountered when the angles are not known. In this paper, a method of "angular reconstitution" is described, which allows the a posteriori determination of the relative angular orientations of the projections and thus enables the three-dimensional reconstruction of the object to be calculated. For asymmetric objects, a minimum of three projections is required, which should not be related by a tilt around a single rotation axis. The method can be applied to determine the three-dimensional structure of biological macromolecules based on electron micrographs of randomly oriented individual molecules. Angular reconstitution, in combination with multivariate statistical techniques to classify and average the characteristic views of a molecule forms a complete, self-contained methodology for molecular structure analysis by electron microscopy.},
