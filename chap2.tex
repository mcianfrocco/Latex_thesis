\subsection{Lobe A is flexibly attached to a stable core of TFIID that comprises lobes B and C}

In previous cryo-EM analyses of human TFIID, the use 3D variance suggested that conformational flexibility is an intrinsic property of TFIID \cite{Grob_1281}. Due to the potential affect that this movement could have on TFIID function, we investigated this property more thoroughly by extensive 2D image analysis of negatively stained TFIID samples (Figure~\ref{fig:Fig2.1}A and Figure~\ref{fig:Fig2.2}A). The resulting 2D averages showed a variety of different TFIID orientations, as seen previously \cite{Grob_1281}. However, upon careful analysis, we noticed that a number of the class averages that initially looked like different views of TFIID, actually corresponded to the same orientation (Figure~\ref{fig:Fig2.2}B). When comparing these averages side-by-side, it becomes clear that there is a common rigid sub-structure within TFIID that is shared between all of the class averages. Surprisingly, a flexibly attached lobe is connected to the rigid sub-structure in a variety of conformations (Figure~\ref{fig:Fig2.2}B). Thus, these class averages indicate that TFIID may exhibit a greater degree of flexibility than previously appreciated.\\

Scale bars are 200\AA.} 
\label{fig:Fig2.2}
\end{figure}
\indent Comparison of these class averages with a 3D model indicated that the flexible domain is lobe A. Alignment of the apo-TFIID 3D model (Figure~\ref{fig:Fig2.3}A - B) with these averages showed that the 3D model aligns the different averages within different orientations of the 3D model (Figure~\ref{fig:Fig2.3}C). However, upon closer investigation, the rigid sub-structure within the re-projections of the 3D model is seen to 'shrink' between the first aligned average (top row, left) and last aligned average (bottom row, right) (Figure~\ref{fig:Fig2.3}C). To improve the alignment between the 3D model and 2D class averages, only the rigid sub-structure of the model was aligned (Figure~\ref{fig:Fig2.3}B \& D). This new model aligned all of the averages within the same orientation, confirming that these class averages correspond to specific structural states within a single orientation of TFIID. Furthermore, this analysis indicates that lobe A is the flexible domain that differs in position relative to the rigid sub-substructure that comprises lobes B and C, termed 'BC core.' \\
\indent To confirm that the conformational flexibility seen for lobe A was not an artifact due to negative staining procedures, cryo-EM data of TFIID were analyzed in an identical manner. Indeed, after performing 2D reference-free alignment on the particles, similar conformational states were observed within the cryo-EM class averages, where lobe A is flexibly attached to a stable BC core (Figure~\ref{fig:Fig2.4}). Thus, lobe A undergoes a 100\AA\ structural reorganization as it changes connectivity from lobe C to lobe B. Given that the structural state where lobe A contacts lobe C corresponds to the previously determined 3D structure of TFIID \cite{Andel_2407,Grob_1281}, we will refer to this state as the 'canonical' state. When lobe A contacts lobe B, TFIID forms a rearranged horseshoe structure, hence we will refer to the newly discovered structure as the 'rearranged' state (Figure~\ref{fig:Fig2.4}).\\

\section{Focused classification \& positional measurements of lobe A describes TFIID's conformational landscape}
After characterizing the extent of lobe A's conformational variability, we wanted to quantify the relative occupancy of each structural state to arrive at a more complete description of TFIID's conformational landscape. To this end, we concentrated on a 'standard' view, where the three main lobes of TFIID, lobes A, B and C, were clearly separated. After performing 2D reference-free alignment, all particles corresponding to this standard view were extracted and re-aligned to a reference of the BC core only (Figure~\ref{fig:Fig2.5}A). The average of these re-aligned particles showed that lobe A was 'blurred-out' due to wide range of conformational states adopted by lobe A (Figure~\ref{fig:Fig2.5}A). Sub-classification within a 2D mask that excluded the stable BC core revealed that lobe A adopts a wide range of positions (Figures~\ref{fig:Fig2.5}B). However, unlike the previously obtained averages (Figure~\ref{fig:Fig2.2}B), this analysis provides a direct comparison of the occupancy of each structural state. \\

\end{figure}
\indent To quantify the structural plasticity exhibited by TFIID, the position of lobe A along the BC core was measured within each sub-classified average. The measurements were normalized so that values greater than 0.70 correspond to particles resembling the canonical state, in which lobe A is at its closest position to lobe C (Figure~\ref{fig:Fig2.5}D). Values less than 0.50, on the other hand, indicate that the particles are in a rearranged state, wherein lobe A is proximal to lobe B (Figure~\ref{fig:Fig2.5}D). This analysis revealed that the position of lobe A can be described by a bi-modal distribution with peaks centered at 0.40 and 0.80 (Figure~\ref{fig:Fig2.5}E and Figure~\ref{fig:Fig2.6}A). Surprisingly, this showed that approximately 50\% of the TFIID particles are found in the rearranged state. These distinct structural states of TFIID were observed in datasets from both cryo-EM and negative stain data, demonstrating that the sample preparation did not alter the results (Figure~\ref{fig:Fig2.5}E). Hence, there are two predominant and structurally distinct states of TFIID that differ the reorganization of lobe A within the complex.

\section{TFIIA and SCP DNA modulate the position of lobe A within TFIID}
\subsection{The combined presence of TFIIA and SCP DNA stabilize the rearranged state}
To examine whether the binding of TFIIA and promoter DNA is linked to the conformational states of TFIID, we analyzed TFIID in the presence of excess SCP DNA and/or the cofactor TFIIA. The SCP contains the TATA box, Inr, MTE, and DPE core promoter motifs (Figure~\ref{fig:Fig1.4}). When TFIID was incubated with SCP DNA and negatively stained samples were visualized and analyzed as described above, lobe A showed a similar distribution of positions relative to TFIID (Figure~\ref{fig:Fig2.6}B) (p = 0.0353, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). This result suggested either that TFIID does not interact with SCP under the conditions used, or that DNA binding does not alter the conformational partitioning of lobe A within the accuracy of our measurements.\\
\indent We then tested whether the presence of TFIIA affects the properties of TFIID. When TFIID was incubated with TFIIA in the absence of DNA, the distribution of lobe A positions was shifted to the peak centered at 0.80. It thus appears that TFIIA stabilizes TFIID in the canonical state  (Figure~\ref{fig:Fig2.6}C). On the other hand, in the presence of SCP DNA, TFIIA promotes the formation of the rearranged state of TFIID, with a strong increase in the peak of lobe A positions centered at 0.40  (Figure~\ref{fig:Fig2.6}D). The distribution of lobe A positions within the context of TFIID-TFIIA  (Figure~\ref{fig:Fig2.6}C) was significantly different from that seen with TFIID-TFIIA-SCP  (Figure~\ref{fig:Fig2.6}D) (p = 1.5 x 10$^{-}$13, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Since TFIID is purified using established protocols \cite{Liu_723,Liu_574}, any underlying biochemical heterogeneity will be constant between these experiments, suggesting that these conformational changes are due to the presence of TFIIA and SCP DNA. These results indicate that TFIIA serves the dual function of maintaining TFIID in the canonical state in the absence of DNA and promoting the formation of the rearranged state in the presence of promoter DNA.\\

\subsection{Cryo-EM analysis verified the presence of DNA within rearranged state of TFIID}
To characterize the structure of this novel rearranged state of TFIID and its binding to DNA, we carried out cryo-EM visualization of frozen hydrated samples. Analysis of 2D reference-free averages from cryo-EM data of the TFIID-TFIIA-SCP ternary complex showed the presence of both the rearranged and canonical states (Figures~\ref{fig:Fig2.7}A \& B, leftmost panels). Importantly, the class averages corresponding to the rearranged state revealed extra density that appeared to be DNA extending across the central channel of TFIID (Figures~\ref{fig:Fig2.7}A, left panel). This additional density was confirmed to be DNA by examining cryo-EM 2D reference-free class averages collected for TFIID, TFIID-SCP, and TFIID-TFIIA. 2D reference-free class averages of TFIID without the combined presence of TFIIA and SCP showed no extra density within the rearranged state (Figure~\ref{fig:Fig2.7}A). These observations suggest that TFIIA is required for efficient binding of TFIID to SCP and that the predominant form of TFIID that is bound to DNA is the novel rearranged state.

\section{Discussion}
Even though conformational flexibility was originally observed for lobe A within frozen-hydrated samples of TFIID \cite{Grob_1281}, this surprising degree of flexibility for lobe A went unappreciated for the past 10 years of research on human TFIID \cite{Andel_2407,Grob_1281,Liu_723,Liu_574}. Furthermore, re-analysis of all datasets of TFIID available reveal the presence of the rearranged conformation, in addition to the continuum of conformational states adopted by lobe A (data not shown). This indicates that the rearranged conformation has been consistently overlooked (e.g. \cite{Liu_723}: Supplemental Figure S4). Given the subtle differences observed between projections of the canonical state when it was aligned to 2D class averages of the rearranged state (Figure~\ref{fig:Fig2.3}C), it is not surprising that this slight difference was overlooked.\\

\indent The pendulum nature of the lobe A's movement relative to the stable BC core suggests that lobe A maintains a connection to the BC core within all conformational states. The nature of this linkage remains unknown and, given that there is not visible extra density connecting lobe A to the BC core, we postulate that the linking domain is an unstructured polypeptide chain. Furthermore, given the lack of information on subunit organization within TFIID, it is difficult to speculate on the composition of lobe A or the BC core at this time (see Chapters 3 \& 4 for model of TFIID composition). Given the large distance (\textgreater 100 \AA\ )that lobe A moves relative to the BC core, understanding the molecular basis for modulating lobe A's position may have important implications for regulating TFIID activity.   \\
