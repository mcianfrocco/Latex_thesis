A mechanistic description of metazoan transcription is essential for understanding the molecular processes that govern cellular decisions. To provide structural insights into the DNA recognition step of transcription initiation, we used single particle electron microscopy to visualize human TFIID with promoter DNA. This analysis revealed that TFIID co-exists in two predominant and distinct structural states that differ by a 100Å translocation of TFIID’s lobe A. The transition between these structural states is modulated by TFIIA, as the presence of TFIIA and promoter DNA facilitates the formation of a novel rearranged state of TFIID capable of promoter recognition and binding. DNA-labeling and footprinting, together with cryo-EM studies, mapped the locations of the TATA, Inr, MTE, and DPE promoter motifs within the TFIID-TFIIA-DNA structure. The existence of two structurally and functionally distinct forms of TFIID suggests that the different conformers may serve as specific targets for the action of regulatory factors.
